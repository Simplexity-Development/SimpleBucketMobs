Throw mobs into buckets! :D

## Permissions
| Permission                      |  What it do                                      | Default |
|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|---------|
| `simplebucketmobs.bucket.<mob>` | Allows the user to bucket the specified mob      | `false` |
| `simplebucketmobs.bucket.all`   | Allows the user to bucket all enabled mobs       | `op`    |
| `simplebucketmobs.reload`       | Reload plugin configuration files                | `op`    |
| `simplebucketmobs.debucket`     | Dump saved mob NBT data from Mob Bucket to chat. | `op`    |

## Texture Configuration

This configuration is `texture.yml` which is specifically used for custom model data. Currently, the custom model data is applied to a bucket.

The texture configuration is made to be customizable in the event you wanted to make special textures for each variant of a mob.

For example, if you wanted to set a special blue sheep texture, rather than just having a generic texture for all sheep.

### Using "default"

The simplest way to assign custom model data is to use the default option.

```yaml
SHEEP:
  default: 1
PIG:
  default: 2
```

This is the easiest way to set it and will set it to all mobs of that type.
In the above example, all sheep will have custom model data 1 and all pigs will have custom model data 2.

### Using the nbtKey and nbtValue

nbtKey and nbtValue are the ways I will be referring to the NBT Tags. nbtValue is our "goal".  The examples are simplified by removing the extra JSON.

Consider a villager's profession...

```json
{ "VillagerData": {"level":1, "profession":"minecraft:none", "type":"minecraft:desert"} }
```

If we want to differentiate custom model data based on a villager's profession, our nbtValue will be "minecraft:none" in this example.

You would get to the nbtValue using all the nbtKeys along the way. This will look like this in your `texture.yml`...

```yaml
VILLAGER:
  VillagerData:
    profession:
      "minecraft:none": 1
```

As shown above, you can use any information stored in the NBT tags to differentiate specific variants of a mob. Here are a few more examples...

**Parrot (Variant)**

```json
{ "Variant": 1 }
```
```yaml
PARROT:
  default: 0
  Variant:
    1: 1
```

**Sheep (Color)**

```json
{ "Color": "2b" }
```
```yaml
SHEEP:
  default: 0
  Color:
    0b: 0
    1b: 1
    2b: 2
```

> **Note**
> 
> You can only use one set of nbtValues (in the villager example, profession).
> 
> The method used to search for the desired nbtValue is not recursive and will not find all possible values.
